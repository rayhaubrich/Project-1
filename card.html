			<p class="description">Common characteristics of modern bears include large
				bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, 
				plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. While 
				the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost 
				entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied
				diets.
